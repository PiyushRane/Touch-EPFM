<b style="font-size = 35px;">Why organisations need to adopt the Touch application?</b><br><br>
Having worked with hospitals (small, mid-sized and large organizations), it is quite evident that the
key stake holders face an acute shortage of medical professionals and even if they been able to
attract the right candidate, the problem remains with regards to motivating and retaining them.
Appraisal mechanism are far too redundant or even non-existent in these settings.
MSI team in partnership with IIT Kanpur (Summer of Code 2019) bring forth Touch an easy to
use application that would not only automate the entire appraisal mechanism, but also brings a
transparent mechanism for measuring work deliverables.
The application also brings Supervisors closer to working with team members and more importantly
gives them almost instant feedback on task assigned.
